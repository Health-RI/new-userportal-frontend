# GDI User Portal Front-end

The GDI User Portal Front-end is a crucial component of the Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) project, which aims to facilitate access to genomic, phenotypic, and clinical data across Europe. The GDI project is committed to establishing a federated, sustainable, and secure infrastructure to enable seamless data access. Leveraging the outcomes of the Beyond 1 Million Genomes (B1MG) project, the GDI project is actively realizing the ambitious goals set forth by the 1+Million Genomes (1+MG) initiative.

The GDI User Portal Front-end serves as the user-friendly interface for this initiative, utilizing [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.3. This frontend application plays a crucial role in enhancing user experience and ensuring efficient interaction with the genomic data infrastructure.

## Installation

### Locally

Before using the GDI User Portal Front-end, make sure you have the required dependencies installed. Follow the installation instructions below:

`npm install`

You also have to create a new `env.local` file in the root directory, and copy the content of `.env.local.example` into the new file. Feel free to modify the environment variables as you wish.

`docker compose up` or `docker-compose up` depending on your docker compose version.

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `.next/` directory.
