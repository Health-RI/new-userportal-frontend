# GDI User Portal Front-end

The GDI User Portal Front-end is a crucial component of the Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) project, which aims to facilitate access to genomic, phenotypic, and clinical data across Europe. The GDI project is committed to establishing a federated, sustainable, and secure infrastructure to enable seamless data access. Leveraging the outcomes of the Beyond 1 Million Genomes (B1MG) project, the GDI project is actively realizing the ambitious goals set forth by the 1+Million Genomes (1+MG) initiative.

The GDI User Portal Front-end serves as the user-friendly interface for this initiative, utilizing [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.3. This frontend application plays a crucial role in enhancing user experience and ensuring efficient interaction with the genomic data infrastructure.
